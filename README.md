# graph-theory-algorithms
Implementing graph theory algorithms.

1. "algorithms_": using the DFS algorithm to implement a Topological Sort and to check whether a graph is a tree. 
2. "labyrinth_": using the BFS algorithm to find all exit paths in a labyrinth, from a given starting node (graph is created from a matrix stored in a .txt file).
3. "algorithms_two": MST (minimum spanning tree) - implemented the Prim algorithm and the Kruskal algorithm.
4. "ford_fulkerson": implemented the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm to compute the maximum flow in a flow network.
